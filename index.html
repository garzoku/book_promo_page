            <h3>“Station Eleven is so compelling, so fearlessly imagined, that I wouldn’t have put it down for
                anything.” —Ann Patchett</h3>
            <article>
                <p>Kirsten Raymonde will never forget the night Arthur Leander, the famous Hollywood actor, had a heart
                    attack on stage during a production of King Lear. That was the night when a devastating flu pandemic
                    arrived in the city, and within weeks, civilization as we know it came to an end.</p>

                <p>Twenty years later, Kirsten moves between the settlements of the altered world with a small troupe of
                    actors and musicians. They call themselves The Traveling Symphony, and they have dedicated
                    themselves to keeping the remnants of art and humanity alive. But when they arrive in St. Deborah by
                    the Water, they encounter a violent prophet who will threaten the tiny band’s existence. And as the
                    story takes off, moving back and forth in time, and vividly depicting life before and after the
                    pandemic, the strange twist of fate that connects them all will be revealed.</p>

                <p>Look for Emily St. John Mandel’s new novel, Sea of Tranquility, coming soon!</p>
